Moviepedia is a React app that utilises The Movie Database API to provide you with information about movies.
Here you can find the trending and top-rated movies at the moment, and also find the similar movies of a specific movie.

You can find it live on this [link](https://danielmsrodrigues.github.io/moviepedia).
