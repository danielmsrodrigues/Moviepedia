<h1>Moviepedia</h1>
Moviepedia is a React app that utilises The Movie Database API to provide you with information about movies.
Here you can find the trending and top-rated movies at the moment, and also find the similar movies of a specific movie. You can also search a movie you like.
<br/>
This project was made during my Web Development course at ETIC.
